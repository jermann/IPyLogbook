## IPyLogbook ##
#### A server-based IPython Notebook data documentation and analysis system ####

IPyLogbook is a server-based system for documentating and analyzing
experiment data via the web-browser based IPython Notebook framework.
This project is very much in its infancy and will likely evolve
greatly in the near future to be more general, flexibly, and
deployable (to say nothing of documented).
