      "The main purpose of today's experiments was to measure the fast neutron flux produced by the $^{10}B(d,n)^{11}C$ and $^{11}B(d,n)^{12}C$ reactions, in addition to neutrons from $(\\gamma,n)$ reactions induced by the 15.11 MeV gammas in high-Z material. It is important to understand the fast neutron flux for this experiment for several reasons:  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Gammas induced by fast neutron inelastic scattering (n,n') reactions produce enormous numbers of gammas that cannot easily be collimated out of the NaI-PMT detector view. This leads to extreme count rates and pileup, in addition to undesirable gammas in the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fast and thermal neutrons may be useful in the measurement of fissile material via delayed neutrons so understanding the effect of shielding and ambient geometry on the potentially confounding neutron spectrum from other reactions is important.\n",
