    "\n",
    "At present, the Logbook assumes that the data to be described has the following directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/HEAD/** : The top level directory containing all experimental data and Logbook system\n",
    " - **20140101/** : Subdirectory for each day's data with the name adhering to the YYYYMMDD format\n",
    " - **20140102/** : ...\n",
    " - **20140108/** : ...\n",
    " - ...    \n",
    " - **LogbookIndex.ipynb** : Notebook that gives a high-level snapshot of the Logbook and links to all entries\n",
    " - **.config** : IPyLogbook configuration file that the user should customize for his/her Logbook\n",
    " - **doc/** : Subdirectory containing IPyLogbook documentation\n",
    "   - **IPyLogbookUsersGuide.ipynb** : Notebook containing details of using the IPyLogbook system\n",
    " - **mgmt/** : Subdirectory containing notebooks to assist in Logbook managemant\n",
    "   - **IPyLogbookManager.ipynb** : Notebook containing Bash scripts to manage the Logbook\n",
    "   - **IPyLogbookExtensions.ipynb** : Notebook to control [IPython-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions)\n",
    "   - **IPyLogbookEntryTemplate.ipynb** : Notebook used as a template for starting new Logbook entries\n",
    "   \n",
    "The *names* of the directories containing data, shown above in YYYYMMDD format, is up to the user, although ordering the directories by date in such a format provides a logical way to keep track of chronologically accumulating data, especially over months and years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The use of IPython-notebook-extensions\n",
    " [IPython-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions) provide a powerful set of enhancements for IPython notebooks, although they are under active development and often a bit buggy. Several of the extensions are particularly useful for IPyLogbook:\n",
    " \n",
    " - **drag-and-drop.js** : Allows images to be drag-and-dropped from the Desktop into the notebook. *This feature is not yet enabled due to buggy behavior in the distributed javascript file (ZSH 12 Dec 14).\n",
    "\n",
    " - **hide_input_all.js** : Obscures the somewhat ungainly Python code required to import and parse the .config file by hiding the Python input cells and only displaying the output on the whole notebook page.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **python-markdown.js** : Extension enables Python variable values to be used within Markdown cells. While this provides nice analysis writups, python-markdown.js enables the IPyLogbook path, url, and ssh port to be read into the Logbook from the .config file and then used within the Markdown cells, such that portability (moving the IPyLogbook from server-to-server) is reduced to simply editing the information within the .config file.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **read-only.js** : Enables individual Notebook cells to be set to 'read-only' such that they may not be edited.\n",
    " \n",
    "Due to the buggy behavior and active development cycle of the IPython-notebook-extensions, a recent snapshot of their GitHub repository has been debugged and is distributed with IPyLogbook. Users should copy this directory into their own .ipython/nbextensions directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find your IPython directory, you can run the following code from within a notebook:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import IPython\n",
    "ip=IPython.get_ipython()\n",
    "ip.ipython_dir\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then copy the IPython-notebook-extensions distributed with IPyLogbook to this directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cp -r IPYLOGBOOK/nbextensions/IPython-notebook-extensions-master IPYDIR\n",
    "```\n",
    "where *IPYLOGBOOK* is the HEAD directory of the IPyLogbook and *IPYDIR* is the user's IPython directory found in the previous step.\n",

The purpose of the Logbook Index is to give the user an easibly navigable way to jump to different entries within the logbook and an quick overview of all the various experimental activities. The user can click on the experiment date - an internet URL link - in order to navigate to that date's logbook entry, which will open in a new browser tab.\n",

The method works by instantiating a class of type ZNotebookCanvas, which is derived from ROOT's TCanvas to inherit all of its methods. Several new methods enable the Canvas contents - once the user has drawn all the objects he/she desired to the ZNotebookCanvas object, to then be inserted into the IPython notebook as an embedded figure.\n",
